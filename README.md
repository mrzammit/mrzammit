- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mrzammit
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software development and architecture. I also have a huge interest in how applications are hosted, scaled, maintained, monitored, and the automation that can go along with it. I also love microcontrollers and using code to interact with the world around me.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced C#/.NET topics and architectures. I'm also working on some DevOps concepts like IaC, containerization, orchestration.
